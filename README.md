** Operators and Expressions in js **

**In JavaScript, operators can be classified into six categories:**

1. Arithmetic operators: Used for basic mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

2. Comparison operators: Used to compare two values or variables and return a Boolean true or false result. Common comparison operators include equality, inequality, strict equality, strict inequality, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to.

3. Logical operators: Used to combine or manipulate Boolean values. Common logical operators include logical AND, logical OR, and logical NOT.

4. Assignment operators: Used to assign values to variables. The most basic assignment operator is the equal sign.

5. Unary operators: Operate on a single value or variable. Common unary operators include increment and decrement.

6. typeof operator: A built-in operator in JavaScript that allows you to determine the data type of a variable or an expression. It returns a string representing the type of the operand.
