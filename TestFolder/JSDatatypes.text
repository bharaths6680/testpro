The three keywords used to declare variables in JavaScript are:
1. var
2. let
3. const

Certainly! Here's an explanation of the scope differences between var, let, and const in JavaScript:

1. var: 
   - Variables declared with var have function-level scope. This means that a variable declared with var is available throughout the entire function in which it is declared.
   - If a variable is declared with var outside of any function, it becomes a global variable and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
   - var variables can be redeclared and reassigned within the same scope.

2. let:
   - Variables declared with let have block-level scope. This means that a variable declared with let is only available within the block enclosed by curly braces in which it is defined.
   - Block-level scope provides more predictability and helps prevent variable name clashes.
   - let variables can be reassigned within the same scope, but they cannot be redeclared.

3. const:
   - Variables declared with const also have block-level scope.
   - const is used to declare variables with constant values, meaning their value cannot be changed once assigned.
   - const variables must be assigned a value when declared and cannot be left uninitialized.
   - const variables cannot be redeclared or reassigned within the same scope.

It's important to choose the appropriate keyword (var, let, or const) based on the desired scope and whether the variable's value should be mutable or constant.


Block-level scope in let and const helps prevent variable name clashes by limiting the visibility of variables to the block of code in which they are defined. Here's how it works:

1. Block-level scope:
   - Block-level scope refers to the scope of a variable within a block of code, which is typically defined by curly braces {}.
   - Variables declared with let and const have block-level scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block of code in which they are defined.
   - This scope is more localized and confined to the specific block, such as a loop or an if statement, where the variable is declared.

2. Preventing variable name clashes:
   - When variables are declared with let or const in different blocks, they can have the same name without causing conflicts.
   - Each block creates a new scope, and variables declared within that block are independent of variables with the same name in other blocks.
   - This prevents unintended variable name clashes and helps maintain code clarity and readability.

By using let and const with block-level scope, you can ensure that variables are only accessible where they are needed and avoid unintentional conflicts between variables with the same name in different parts of your code.

1. Primitive Data Types:
   - Primitive data types are basic data types that represent a single value.
   - JavaScript has several primitive data types, including:
     - String: Represents text and is enclosed in single or double quotes.
     - Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers.
     - Boolean: Represents true or false values.
     - Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value.
     - Null: Represents an empty value or absence of any object value.
   - Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once assigned.
   - When you perform operations on primitive data types, you create new values rather than modifying the existing ones.

2. Composite Data Types:
   - Composite data types are used to organize and manipulate collections of data as a single unit.
   - JavaScript has two main composite data types:
     - Array: Represents a list-like data structure for storing multiple values. Arrays can contain elements of any data type and are accessed using numeric indices.
     - Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs used for structured data storage. Objects can contain properties of any data type and are accessed using property names.
   - Composite data types are mutable, meaning their values can be modified by adding, updating, or removing elements or properties.
   - Operations on composite data types directly modify the existing values.

Understanding the difference between primitive and composite data types is crucial for effective JavaScript programming, as it helps in working with different kinds of data and performing various operations on them.
